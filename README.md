# Osaka Memory Card Game

Welcome to the **Osaka Memory Card Game**! This is a basic memory card matching game featuring Osaka, a character from _Azumanga Daioh_. The game is simple and it works well in its current state. There’s plenty of room for improvement, and I would really like if someone contributes to it.

## How to play

- Simply click on two cards to flip them over.
- If the cards match, they stay revealed; if they don’t, they will flip back after a short delay.
- The goal is to find all the matching pairs in the shortest amount of moves.
